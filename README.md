## 💻 About the project
The player tries to find out what is the secret number. Dont't forget to give it a go on mobile because this webpage is responsive!

## 🤔 How it works
The player tries to find out what is the secret number by filling the empty field with a number between 1 and 20. If the number typed is higher than the secret number, a message shows up indicating that the number is too high, the same happens if the number is too low. Whenever the player makes a mistake, he loses 1 point from the score, if it reaches 0 it's game over. If he finds the secret number before losing the points, he wins the game. The player can restart the game by clicking on the again button. By doing that, the game starts over, but you keep the highscore from the previous round.
